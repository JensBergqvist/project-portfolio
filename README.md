# portfolio
The assignment was to create my first developer portfolio based on a set desgin sketch. and make it pass through validation tools.

THE PROBLEM:
By using HTML and CSS to make my portfolio look as close to the template as possible.  I've struggled alot this week with panicattacks, total mental blackouts. I know it's not styled for tablet yet so I will have to do that later on. Wich is also what I would have done if I had more time.  It's been a fun project to do, and I've learned alot!
