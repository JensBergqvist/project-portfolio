# portfolio
The assignment was to create my first developer portfolio based on a set desgin sketch. and make it pass through validation tools.

THE PROBLEM:
By using HTML and CSS to make my portfolio look as close to the template as possible. If I had more time I would have made it look more personal, but it's a work in progress so I will come back to it!  It's been a fun project to do, and I've learned alot!
